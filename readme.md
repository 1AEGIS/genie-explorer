# genie-explorer

Web application for viewing contents of Genie DRS archives.

[Live version](http://genie-explorer.surge.sh)

A small [choo][] app using [genie-drs][], [genie-slp][] and [jascpal][] to read and show information from DRS files.
It's still unfinished in places, but works OK!
It's compiled to a single `index.html` file using `npm run build`.
